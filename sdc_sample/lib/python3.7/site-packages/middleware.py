"""
    This class models the data received from the SpaceX API according to our
    specified format. It calls a function to populate its data model, since we
    expect to change our retrieval mechanism in the near future. This ensures
    that we should only need to update the function call to populate the model 
    with new data, and can develop these functions independently of one another.
    This should also make testing easier because the functions are more atomic
    and can also be tested in parallel for performance improvements, if desired
